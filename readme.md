Extension has several panels in the tab:

* Model - tools that do different things in the model space, mainly to quickly do something
* Automation - Scripts that automate boring tasks
* Dynamo - same as Automation, but haven't  got the time or energy to create pyRevit versions 
* Application - not sure, it was fun
* Family Tools - tools only available in the family editor
* BIM manager - tools only a PRO should use
* Other Tools - tools that colleagues request  🧑‍🏭

Every tool has an embedded description. To see the description and hint, hover mouse over the button
